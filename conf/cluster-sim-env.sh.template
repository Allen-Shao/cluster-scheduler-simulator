# Copy this file to cluster-sim-env.sh and add configuration settings here.

# Export environment variables for your site in this file. Some useful
# variables to set are:

# JAVA_OPTS, used in the Java command line in bin/sbt. For example, to set
#            the heap size, make this -Xmx500m for a 500meg heap or
#            -Xmx1G for 1gig heap (this example is commented out below).
# export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1Gm"
